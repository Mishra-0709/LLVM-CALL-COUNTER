**ðŸš€ LLVM Redundant Instruction Elimination Pass**

This project demonstrates how to write an LLVM optimization pass in C++ that eliminates redundant instructions in LLVM IR (e.g., add x, 0 or mul x, 1). It showcases compiler-level optimization techniques and the LLVM pass infrastructure.

ðŸ“Œ Project Description
The Redundant Instruction Elimination Pass traverses LLVM Intermediate Representation (IR) and removes operations that do not affect the final outcome â€” optimizing runtime performance by simplifying unnecessary instructions.

This is an introductory compiler project for those interested in LLVM, compiler optimization, or program analysis.

ðŸ”§ Features
Identifies and removes instructions like:

add x, 0

mul x, 1

x = x

Preserves IR validity and correctness

Easily extendable for more optimizations

ðŸ§° Requirements
LLVM (version 16 or above)

CMake (>= 3.13)

Clang (for generating IR)

VS Code (recommended for development)

C++ compiler (with C++17 or newer)
